The contents of corp.html and runner.html were entirely AI generated, except for the contents of the `Config` variable.

Everything else present is human code used to generate the information that needs to go in the `Config` variable.

**Usage**
1. One player, the host, chooses which side they want to draft first (I recommend corp).
2. That player chooses a pack algorithm and a number of rounds, currently you should use `NineCardsOneRare` and `4`.
3. That player adds the names of everyone in the draft, hits shuffle, and then hits Generate Draft & Links.
4. The host sends the links generated to each player in the draft to open, and opens their own.
5. Choose the card you want from the pack you see.
6. Hit Copy and send the message added to your clipboard to the player who it tells you to send it to.
7. Wait for a message from the player before you in draft order, click the link they send you and go back to step 5.
8. Eventually you will get a pack with only one card in it, after choosing it you can see your full list of cards formatted for JNET. This is also visible at the bottom of the page on every draft pick you make.

The pack algorithm here in particular guaruntees you each pack will contain one good card (top 40 ish in the cardpool on trash or busto), a spread of cards from every faction, and a spread of cards from every card type.
